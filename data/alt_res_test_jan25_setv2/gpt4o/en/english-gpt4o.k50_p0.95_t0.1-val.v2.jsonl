However, we do have some information about early settlers and pioneers who played significant roles in the development of the community.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded settlers was John H. McMurtry, who arrived in 1835. He is believed to have built a log cabin near the present-day site of Steelville. McMurtry served as the first postmaster when the town's post office was established in 1840.\n\nAnother early settler was John H. Dillon, who came to the area around 1836.
