This allows the GPU to access data stored in system memory as if it were located in its own local memory, improving performance and reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the CPU and GPU over the bus.\n\nOn the other hand, an I/O MMU is a hardware component that manages the memory mapping for I/O devices. It translates virtual addresses used by the CPU into physical addresses in the I/O device's memory space, allowing the CPU to access I/O devices as if they were regular memory. This can help improve system performance and security by hiding the complexities of I/O addressing from the CPU and providing a more consistent memory model for software.\n\nSo while both GARTs and I/O MMUs deal with memory mapping and addressing, they serve different purposes in the system.
