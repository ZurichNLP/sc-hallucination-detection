There, in 1975, his unit was involved in an incident in which a group of soldiers killed a South Korean civilian. This led to his demotion and transfer to a less prestigious unit. Following the assassination of Kim Jong-il in 2011, and the subsequent power struggle between his two sons, Kim Jung-un and Kim Young Un, it was widely speculated that Chohung would be appointed Prime minister. However, this did not happen and Chung Eui-Yong was instead chosen. It is not clear if Chon was ever considered for the position.
