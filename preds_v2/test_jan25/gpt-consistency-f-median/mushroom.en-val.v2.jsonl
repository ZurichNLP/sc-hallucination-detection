McMurtry served as the first postmaster when the town's post office was established in 1840.\n\nAnother early settler was John H. Dillon, who came to the area around 1836.

McClure, who arrived in the late 1830s or early 1840s. These families were among the founders of the First Presbyterian Church in Steelville, which was organized in 1842.\n\nIt's important to note that these settlers likely arrived in small groups over an extended period of time, and there may have been other early settlers whose names are not recorded in history.

After the death of his father, Choy was sent to the military academy in Pyongsung, where he graduated in 1970. In 1972, he was assigned to work in North Hamgyong Province. There, in 1975, his unit was involved in an incident in which a group of soldiers killed a South Korean civilian. This led to his demotion and transfer to a less prestigious unit. Following the assassination of Kim Jong-il in 2011, and the subsequent power struggle between his two sons, Kim Jung-un and Kim Young Un, it was widely speculated that Chohung would be appointed Prime minister. However, this did not happen and Chung Eui-Yong was instead chosen. It is not clear if Chon was ever considered for the position.
